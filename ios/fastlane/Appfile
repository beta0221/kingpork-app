# Appfile - Apple account and app configuration
# For more information about the Appfile, see:
#     https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/#appfile

# Your Apple ID email address
# Replace with your actual Apple Developer account email
app_identifier("tw.com.kingpork.app") # The bundle identifier of your app

# Your Apple Developer Portal Team ID
# You can find this in your Apple Developer account:
# https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership/
# Or run: fastlane produce -u YOUR_APPLE_ID
team_id("V4C8JA4SFU")

# Your Apple ID
# This is the Apple ID used to access App Store Connect and the Developer Portal
apple_id("beta0221@gmail.com")

# App Store Connect Team ID (if different from Developer Portal Team ID)
# This is usually needed when you have multiple teams
# itc_team_id("YOUR_APP_STORE_CONNECT_TEAM_ID")

# If you want to use App Store Connect API Key instead of Apple ID:
# This is the recommended approach for CI/CD
